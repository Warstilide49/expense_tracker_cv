## Easier Expense Tracking

In an attempt to make tracking my expenses easier, came this idea of learning computer vision through it. More precisely, I want to learn ways to do OCR using OpenCV and making use of Raspberry Pi Cam.

### New topics learnt

[Adaptive Thresholding](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html)

[Morphological Operations](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d61/tutorial_py_morphological_ops.html)

### Deviation

Given how much i had to tweak the parameters for different images for Tesseract to make sense of them, it was far easier to just feed a reduced size image to easyocr instead. It's got great accuracy for even crumbled receipts. So yeah. More efficient but less learning.

However I still need to integrate this with Raspi, so hopefully there's more learnings to come!
